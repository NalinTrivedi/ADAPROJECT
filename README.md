# ADAPROJECT
The aim of the project is to create an interactive visualizer that visualizes various algorithms to find the shortest path between two nodes in a path with or without obstacles. 
•	The site gives the users flexibility to visualize various algorithms among the best-known shortest path finding algorithms. 
•	This visualizer will automatically generate a grid with two randomly placed node. 
•	This also gives the user options to add random walls in grid so that they can visualize various possibilities. 

The project provides all the basic features of professionally built web apps and is ready to update and fix any bugs which makes this app much better and real-world oriented.
